## 📐 Assumptions

1. **Mock HTTP Service** — The backend is mocked via `MockHttpClient` with 400ms simulated latency. It is pre-seeded with one user (`Ahmed Al Rashid`, balance AED 2,500) and two beneficiaries.

2. **Verification Toggle** — The user's verification status (`isVerified`) is toggled via a chip in the app bar for demonstration purposes. In production, this would come from the backend.

3. **Monthly Totals** — The current month's top-up totals for the user and each beneficiary are tracked in the mock and persisted locally in Hive. They are not reset automatically (a real backend would handle calendar-month resets).

4. **Offline Queue** — When offline, top-up transactions are queued in Hive's `pendingTopUpsBox` using a FIFO strategy. They are synced automatically when connectivity is restored (via `ConnectivityService` stream).

5. **Error Rollback** — Adding/deleting beneficiaries uses an optimistic local write. If the remote call subsequently fails, the UI shows an error but does not automatically rollback the local state (acceptable for a mock backend).

6. **UAE Phone Validation** — Accepts numbers in the format `+971 5X XXXXXXX`.
